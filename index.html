      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p class="intro">I am studying full-stack software development to become a Full-stack
        software Developer. The curriculum includes: Html, CSS, JavaScript,
        Python, SQL and Django.
      </p>

      <br>

      <p class="intro">From the moment I wrote “Hello World!” in the my first Python
        application, I was hooked into the world of software development,
        But software development has never been “just a job for me!” It has
        offered me an engaging challenge to continually learn and improve
        my skills in creating high quality software. What started as a simple
        “Hello World!” has become a full fledged passion that only gets more
        exciting as time goes by.
      </p>

      <br>

      <p class="intro">I am also a father of an absolutely amazing 2 year old, who has
        started nursery lately and who has started talking recently. He is my
        little bundle of joy, who keeps me on my toes. I love taking him to the
        park and spending good quality family time together.
